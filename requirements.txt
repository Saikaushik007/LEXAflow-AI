# ===========================

# Core libraries for data manipulation and handling
numpy==1.26.0           # For numerical operations, arrays, and calculations
pandas==2.1.0           # For structured data handling and reading/writing data

# Web framework for API endpoints (optional, if you extend the prototype)
fastapi==0.108.0        # Lightweight Python web framework to expose APIs
uvicorn==0.23.1         # ASGI server to run FastAPI applications

# Natural Language Processing (NLP) & AI tools
nltk==3.8.1             # Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing
scikit-learn==1.3.2     # Machine learning algorithms for intent detection or vector search

# JSON handling and file operations
# Built-in Python modules (json, pathlib) handle this, no installation needed

# Optional - vector search & semantic embeddings (if you extend AI capabilities)
sentence-transformers==2.2.2  # For converting text to embeddings for semantic search

# ===========================
# Notes:
# ===========================
# 1. These packages cover both the current prototype and potential AI/NLP extensions.
# 2. If your prototype only reads JSON and prints responses, you only need the standard library.
# 3. Installing these ensures the project can be extended without modifying requirements.
